  <h1>About Extenda</h1>
  <p class="image-float-right"><%= image_tag "extenda_logo.png"%> </p>
  <p>Extenda Communications was founded in 1969 in Los Angeles, CA. Our mission since our inception has been to provide small and medium sized businesses with the communications systems, features, and expert service available to big companies.</p>
  <h2>Leading the Charge</h2>
  <p>Extenda has been at the forefront of change since the breakup of the national telephone monopoly. From the first imported telephone systems from Mitel and Telrad, to the first PC-based phone systems with the Inter-Tel Axxent, to the first commercially available IP telephones in the late 1990s to our current lineup of software-based telephony solutions from Zultys and Mitel, Extenda has been at the cutting edge of technology.</p>
  <h2>Introducing ExtendaCloud</h2>
  <p>ExtendaCloud is our VoIP (SIP) bases, cloud-hosted telephone system and real-time communications product. With a simple, per user rental model, customers enjoy fixed monthly costs, unlimited US long distance calling, local and toll free phone numbers, and a host of great features that vary by license level.

  <h3>The Nuts and Bolts</h3>
  <p>We have virtualized our commercial telephone system offerings and host them in a SAS70 data center, and connect these systems to best-of-breed SIP connections. This means that you do not have to compromise on features with a one-size-fits-all system offered by our competition. Most cloud telephony companies are stamping out a template for all of their small business customers, without regard to how your company works.
  </p>
  <p>All we require for you to connect to our service are electrical power for the phones (called Power over Ethernet, usually provided by a switch or a power supply), internet connectivity (100 kilobits per second per phone), and, on occassion, we need to adjust strong security policies to make sure your phones are not blocked from reaching our servers.
